The goal of sfnetworks is to fill a missing block in Râ€™s provision for
spatial network analysis.

The `sfnetworks` package is currently under active development, and
breaking changes will be made in the coming months. The current master
branch is released as `v0.1.0`, but will soon be succeeded by a new
version, with different classes and functions. These classes and
functions are developed in the develop branch, which you are currently
viewing. Feel free to already open issues containing ideas of what
functionalities you think should be included in the new package version
(please use the `feature` issue template for this).

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of sfnetworks from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->
