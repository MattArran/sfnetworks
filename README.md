The goal of sfnetworks is to fill a missing block in Râ€™s provision for spatial network analysis. Read more about the idea and the currently implemented functionalities in the `vignette("intro")` and `vignette("extensions")`.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of sfnetworks from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("sfnetworks") -->

<!-- ``` -->

The `sfnetworks` package is still in very active development, Therefore, the package is also not on CRAN yet. Install it directly from GitHub using the `remotes` package in R.

Install the more stable master branch with:

```r
remotes::install_github("luukvdmeer/sfnetworks")
```

Install the `develop` branch, where most of the development takes place and where PRs should be directed, as follows:

```r
remotes::install_github("luukvdmeer/sfnetworks", ref = "develop")
```

Originally, `sfnetworks` was created as a homework assignment for an R course. Some people actually started using that version of the package in their work. Note that the new package is completely different! If you still want to install the original version, use:

```r
remotes::install_github("luukvdmeer/sfnetworks@v0.1")
```

## Contribution
We look very much forward to contributions to the package. Please refer to the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for further details.
