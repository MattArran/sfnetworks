# How to contribute?

We look very much forward to contributions to the package. This can be in the form of pull requests (please direct them to the `develop` branch), but also by opening issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues). Such issues can be specific feature requests labeled with the `feature` label (e.g. "I would like to see a function `f(x)` that accepts an object `x` of class `foo` and returns < this >"). It can also be a more generic description of problems that you deal with when working with spatial networks in R (e.g. "I usually find it impossible/confusing/complicated to do < this >").

We strive to follow the [tidyverse styleguide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) in the source code of the package. An exception to that is the assignment operator: we use `=` instead of `<-` (see [here](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues/319) for some reasons why).

This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.
