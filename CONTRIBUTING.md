# How to contribute?

We look very much forward to contributions to the package. This can be done in several ways:

- Create a pull request with a specific feature implementation or bug fix. Please direct them to the `develop` branch. We strive to follow the [tidyverse styleguide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) in the source code of the package. An exception to that is the assignment operator: we use `=` instead of `<-` (see [here](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues/319) for some reasons why).
- Open an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues) to request a specific feature or report a bug. Please use the respective issue templates for this.
- Share more general ideas you have for the package by starting a new discussion in the [discussion room](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/discussions), using the [ideas category](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AIdeas).
- Share the experiences you have with using the package in your work by starting a new discussion in the [discussion room](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/discussions), using the [show and tell category](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/discussions?discussions_q=category%3A%22Show+and+tell%22). Sharing this will help the package developers to see how the package is used and improve things accordingly, and other users to learn more about the package and get inspiration for their work!
- Ask questions by starting a new discussion in the [discussion room](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/discussions), using the [Q&A category](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AQ%26A), or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sfnetwork) with the sfnetwork tag. Asking your questions openly helps other users that struggle with the same problems!
