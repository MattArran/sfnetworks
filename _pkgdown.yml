  - title: Construction
    desc: >
      The core of the package is a data structure that can be provided as 
      input to both graph analytical functions of `tidygraph` and to spatial 
      analytical functions of `sf`, without the need for conversion.

  - title: Extensions
    desc: >
      The package extends the existing functionalities of `tidygraph` and `sf` 
      with a set of functions specific for spatial network analysis.
    contents:
      - st_network_paths
      - st_network_cost
      - st_network_join
      - st_network_blend
      - st_network_bbox
      - spatial_node_predicates
      - spatial_edge_predicates
      - spatial_edge_measures
      - spatial_morphers
  - title: Integration with sf
    desc: >
      The package enables smooth integration with `sf` by implementing several 
      sfnetwork methods for sf functions.
    contents:
      - sf
      - sf_attr
      - as_tibble.sfnetwork
  - title: Visualization
    desc: >
      The package offers basic plot methods. For more advanced plotting, the 
      use of specific plotting and mapping libraries is recommended.
