In this release I have made the following changes:

- A startup message is included to urge users of PROJ <= 6 to recreate the CRS for the `Roxel` dataset. Refs [#190](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/190) and fixed with [#193](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/pull/193).
- Example using GraphML in [vignette 1](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/articles/sfn01_structure.html) has been removed provisionally to address [#194](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/194).
